# Abstractive-Text-Summarization
With the exponential growth of textual data available on the internet, the need for effective automatic text summarization has become crucial. Abstractive text summarization, a subfield of natural language processing (NLP), aims to generate concise and coherent summaries that capture the main ideas and salient information from the source text. Unlike extractive summarization, which selects and rearranges portions of the original text, abstractive techniques involve generating new phrases and sentences that may not be present in the source document. This paper provides a comprehensive review of abstractive text summarization techniques, discusses the challenges associated with this task, and presents recent advances in the field
